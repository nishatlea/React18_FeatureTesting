single page application (index.html)
Folder structure with short description:
index.html => root (div id)
web vitals  => performance & analytics tracking
app.css => styling app.js
app.test.js => unit test (simple test case)
index.css => style index.js
logo.svg => used in app.js 
setup tests => testing
index.html => served in the browser & contains root dom node 

Components:
1.used in .js file
2. 2 types : functional component , class component 
Functional component:
properties(props) => JS Function => html(jsx)
3.exporting & importing
instead of using export default Greet 
we can use import {Greet} from "./components/Greet" at the time of importing and use export keyword at the time of defining the function.

JSX differences with html
class => className
for => htmlfor
camelCase Property naming convention
onclick => onClick
-.-
jsx produces react elements

Props:
Props are immutable . Their values can't be changed
props get passed to component 
Function parameters

Children props:
Children props are very useful when you have to compose new component from existing component
Every props and child props and all html tags should be between only one wrapper element

State:
State is managed within the component 
Variables declared in the function body
State can be changed
